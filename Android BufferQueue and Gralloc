BufferQueue
The BufferQueue class connects components that generate buffers of graphical data (producers) to components that accept the data for display or further processing (consumers). 
Nearly everything that moves buffers of graphical data through the system relies on BufferQueue.

The Gralloc memory allocator performs buffer allocations and is implemented through two vendor-specific HIDL interfaces 
The allocate() function takes expected arguments (width, height, pixel format) as well as a set of usage flags.

Gralloc
The Gralloc allocator HAL hardware/libhardware/include/hardware/gralloc.h performs buffer allocations through usage flags. Usage flags include attributes such as:
How often the memory will be accessed from software (CPU)
How often the memory will be accessed from hardware (GPU)
Whether the memory will be used as an OpenGL ES (GLES) texture
Whether the memory will be used by a video encoder
